# HIBIT 2020 â€“ Poster information

Contributors wishing to present their work at HIBIT 2020 as a poster presentation are invited to submit an abstract through the submission system on the conference website. All abstracts will be reviewed by the scientific committee, and the authors of those selected for presentation will be informed by **3 August 2020**.

All selected abstracts will be printed in the conference abstract book and assigned a board in the poster session. During the event, a prize will be awarded for the best poster presentation.

Posters should be printed at A0 size or similar (841 mm x 1189 mm) and in portrait orientation.

Please note the organizing committee cannot arrange poster printing, however it is possible for contributors to print posters at the Cemil Copy Center in the SU campus. Presenters wishing to do this should contact Cemil Copy at least a week before the event during business hours on: +90 216 483 9460.
