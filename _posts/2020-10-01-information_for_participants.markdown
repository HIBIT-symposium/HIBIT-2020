HIBIT 2020 will be held on the 22nd-23rd of October. Registrations will be open and FREE until October 15th.

#####  Dedicate your time as much as possible for two days

We try our best to create a virtual environment that resembles the physical conference as much as possible. This would be possible with your full, uninterrupted attendance. We, therefore, kindly suggest you to dedicate your time as much as possible for 2 days to HIBIT 2020.

#####  Listening to the talks

The event will take place on Zoom Webinar. You do not need a registered Zoom account. We will send the video conference link to your emails that you used for registration. It is important that you do not share this with others, as the room will have a limit of attendees. For the same reason, if you attend late, we cannot guarantee your participation.

#####  Coffee breaks

We will send the participants to breakout rooms for networking. You will see the speakers, chairs and other participants in the breakout room. If you are willing to go to the breakroom with a speaker, you can let the organizers (hibit2020@gmail.com) know about your request before the conference. We will try our best to create a small room for people who can interact with each other.

#####  How to ask questions?

During the event, the questions will be asked in Q/A window by text. Only session chairs and panelists will see your written questions. The session chair will select the questions and ask them to the speaker.

#####  How to visit posters?

A private link for posters will be provided before the conference. You will have a chance to examine the posters online before and during the conference. Posters will be removed from the website on October 25th.

During the poster sessions, each poster will have a dedicated video conference link. The password will be provided to HIBIT participants via e-mail. You will have a chance to visit the poster online and have a one-to-one session with the poster presenter.
