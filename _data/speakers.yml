  abstract: "Advancements in omics technologies facilitated studying complex diseases to reveal individual mechanisms of disease development and identification of personalized therapy targets. Bioinformatics methods developed tend to maximize model performance metrics and most frequently result in developing models that do not make sense clinically that's why they are not used in daily practice in medicine though they are useful to understand mechanisms at play in disease etiology. There is an imminent demand by physicians to translate these AI models into daily use that's why bioinformaticians need to develop models that make sense to clinicians so that they can be easily adopted in their daily practice. In this presentation, I will briefly talk about Bioinformatics methods that are used to develop models in studying complex diseases and give examples on how to modify them to develop clinically actionable models."

  abstract_title: "Towards understanding the factors tuning specific biomolecular interactions"
  abstract: "The interplay between specificity and affinity is a significant drive in biomolecular recognition. For many systems, the experimental determination of these factors has been challenging, which has aroused interest in computational prediction of binding affinity/specificity. Numerous algorithms are poised to calculate the binding affinity of biomolecular complexes. On the other hand, there is only a handful of approaches tuned to predict the specificity of binding. To that end, we have developed novel and simple specificity metrics upon working on two model systems. Our metrics are based on the statistical analysis of dynamic interaction profiles of intermolecular surfaces. In our first model system, we uncover that a specific salt-bridge network directs the ligand selection of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase Axl. In our second system, we reveal that distinct hydrogen bonding profiles explain the sequence specificity of de novo DNA methyltransferases. We are currently exploring the generic applicability of our metrics to epigenetics-related systems."

  abstract_title: "Proximity-based proteomics uncovers new mechanisms underlying rare developmental disorders"
  abstract: "The centrosome/cilium complex is required for key functions ranging from cell division to cellular signaling and its deregulation causes various human diseases including cancer and ciliopathies. To elucidate disease mechanisms, it is essential to determine how centrosomes and cilia assemble and function in time and in space. To this end, we used innovated proximity-based proximity-based labeling approaches and generated spatial and temporal interaction maps for functional modules mutated in various ciliopathies including retinal degeneration and Joubert syndrome. Functional and molecular characterization of these functional modules identified CCDC66 as a new component of the centrosome/cilium complex that regulates cilium biogenesis, ciliary transport and ciliary signaling. Using live imaging and FRAP experiments, we identified centriolar satellites as regulators of centrosomal and ciliary targeting of CCDC66. Strikingly, CCDC66-positive satellites underwent frequent splitting and fusion events, analogous to the dynamic behavior of liquid-like membrane-less compartments. Finally, we showed that CCDC66 directly binds to microtubules and localizes to the microtubule-based structures of the cilium, suggesting a link between them and ciliopathy disease mechanisms. Taken together, our results uncovered new mechanisms that underlie ciliopathies and showed the power of proximity proteomics in discovery-based research."

  abstract: "Mutation rates in human somatic cells are highly heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity is variable across different resolutions, from the single-nucleotide scale to the megabase-sized chromosomal domain scale.  We suggest that variable local activity of DNA repair pathways is a common factor underpinning mutation rate diversity across the human genome.  A common principle is that gene-rich, active chromatin regions tend to be protected from mutagenesis.  We also highlight examples where DNA repair can be co-opted by mutagens, resulting in mutational processes that are unusually impactful because they are directed towards active chromatin."

  abstract_title: "Lineage tracing of human embryonic development and foetal haematopoiesis through somatic mutations"
  abstract: "To date, ontogeny of the human haematopoietic system during foetal development has been characterized mainly through careful microscopic observations. Here we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 511 single-cell derived haematopoietic colonies from healthy human foetuses of 8 and 18 post-conception weeks (pcw) coupled with deep targeted sequencing of tissues of known embryonic origin to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of blood development. We found that in healthy foetuses, individual haematopoietic progenitors acquire tens of somatic mutations by 18 pcw. Using these mutations as barcodes, we timed the divergence of embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues during development and estimated the number of blood antecedents at different stages of embryonic development. Our analysis has shown that ectoderm originates from a smaller set of blood antecedents compared to endoderm and mesoderm. Finally, our data support a hypoblast origin of the extra-embryonic mesoderm and primitive blood in humans."

  abstract_title: "Computational Enzymology: The structure, function and evolution of enzymes"
  abstract: "We seek to understand how enzymes work and how they evolve to perform new enzyme functions using computational biology approaches. 
Almost all domains that perform catalysis have evolved to work on numerous substrates. We have generated family trees, showing the evolution of these new specificities, and gaining a broad overview of enzyme evolution as we know it today. But we find that each family is different and careful analysis is required to understand individual mechanisms. In this talk I will focus on three practical topics relevant to understanding enzyme catalysis:- 

(1) Analysis of basic catalytic machinery in proteins
(2) A new way to estimate substrate transformations and find the most appropriate enzymes or pathways to transform a given substrate into a given product.  
(3) Towards predicting enzyme mechanisms
These approaches will allow us to analyse complex enzyme families, their mechanisms and their evolution and maybe ultimately help in the design of new enzymes.

  abstract_title: "How novel sensors arise in bacteria"
  abstract: "Bacteria possess various receptors that monitor changes in the environment and help adjusting cellular functions accordingly. The number of receptors in bacterial genomes varies significantly and different bacterial species seem to evolve unique receptors. Where do these novel receptors come from? Here, I will consider several basic mechanisms for their birth, using bacterial chemoreceptors as a model. In the first example, I will show how gene duplication serves as a foundation for evolving novel ligand specificities, while preserving conserved signaling determinants. In the second example, I will show how two proteins come together to form a novel receptor in a plug-and-play fashion. In the third example, I will demonstrate how a single alpha-helix insertion transformed a classical ligand-binding domain into a redox sensor. Finally, these three examples will be placed into a wider concept of molecular evolution of sensing and signaling in bacteria."

  abstract_title: "Identifying effector genes of human GWAS variants by INFIMA"
  abstract: "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed many non-coding single nucleotide variants that are statistically associated with complex traits and diseases. However, the effector genes through which these disease risk variants mediate their effects are largely unknown. Recently, transcriptome-wide association studies that leverage reference transcriptomes have emerged as a powerful tool for revealing candidate disease-related genes when disease-relevant reference transcriptomes exist. However, they lack the ability to link risk variants to their effector genes. Surprisingly, model organism studies have also largely remained as an untapped resource for unveiling such effector genes. A recent well-powered expression quantitative locus (eQTL) study in islets from Diversity Outbred (DO) mice identified thousands of eQTLs; however, it lacked the resolution to pinpoint causal single nucleotide variants and the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the wide range in susceptibility to diabetes due to high linkage disequilibrium. To address this bottleneck and leverage eQTLs derived from DO mice for elucidating effector genes of human GWAS variants, we developed a statistical data integration model, INFIMA for Integrative Fine-Mapping with Model Organism Multi-Omics Data.  INFIMA capitalizes on multi-omics data modalities such as chromatin accessibility and transcriptome from the  eight DO mice founder strains to fine-map DO islet eQTLs. In addition, INFIMA employs footprinting and in silico mutation analysis to reveal regulatory genetic variants  that mediate strain-specific expression differences.   We applied INFIMA to identify novel effector genes in pancreatic islets for human GWAS variants associated with diabetes. We computationally validated INFIMA predictions with high-resolution chromatin capture data sets from mouse and human islets. Our results demonstrate that INFIMA is a powerful method for leveraging model organism multi-omics data to identify candidate effector genes of non-coding human GWAS variants and performs better than baseline alternatives."
