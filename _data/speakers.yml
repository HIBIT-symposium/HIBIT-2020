  bio: "Igor B. Jouline is the Rod Sharp Endowed Professor in the Department of Microbiology and a Co-Director of Computational Health and Life Sciences at The Ohio State University Translational Data Analytics Institute. His research focuses on the evolution of genes, including those implicated in various diseases. Dr. Jouline was a Wellcome Trust Fellow at the University of Oxford (United Kingdom) and a Distinguished Staff Member at the US Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He served as a Chair of the International Odysseus Jury (Belgian Research Foundation) and several review panels at the National Institutes of Health. He was elected to the American Academy of Microbiology in 2017 and became a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019. Dr. Jouline received his BS in biology and MS in biophysics from Saratov State University (Russia), and his PhD in microbiology from St. Petersburg State University (Russia)."
  title: "How novel sensors arise in bacteria"
  abstract: "Bacteria possess various receptors that monitor changes in the environment and help adjusting cellular functions accordingly. The number of receptors in bacterial genomes varies significantly and different bacterial species seem to evolve unique receptors. Where do these novel receptors come from? Here, I will consider several basic mechanisms for their birth, using bacterial chemoreceptors as a model. In the first example, I will show how gene duplication serves as a foundation for evolving novel ligand specificities, while preserving conserved signaling determinants. In the second example, I will show how two proteins come together to form a novel receptor in a plug-and-play fashion. In the third example, I will demonstrate how a single alpha-helix insertion transformed a classical ligand-binding domain into a redox sensor. Finally, these three examples will be placed into a wider concept of molecular evolution of sensing and signaling in bacteria."
